Hi, I’m @MeriSimp
I’m interested in DDR like games, Roblox, Minecraft, Scratch, and painting.
I’m currently learning RobotC, C++, and Lua
I’m looking to collaborate on a FNF mod
How to reach me - Through Scratch (UninvitedD), or my Gmail (CG5Hater69420@gmail.com, I share my gmail with someone else.) 

 - About me -
I make fnf covers and am working on a daddy dearest reskin. I am indeed a Meri simp, and a Ena simp, and a Moony simp, and you get the idea.
I ride skateboard and sleep on a couch futon.
